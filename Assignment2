1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
A.Two values are True and False, and denoted as True & False
2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
A. They are  AND, OR, and NOT
3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
A. Basically there can be 4 truth tables of ‘==’, “AND’, ‘OR’, ‘NOT’
Truth Table FOR == 
x	==	y	Returns
True	==	True	True
True	==	False	False
False	==	True	False
False	==	False	True
AND Truth Table
x	and	y	Returns
True	and	True	True
True	and	False	False
False	and	True	False
False	and	False	False
OR Truth Table
x	or	y	Returns
True	or	True	True
True	or	False	True
False	or	True	True
False	or	False	False

NOT Truth Table
not	x	Returns
not	True	False
not	False	True

4. What are the values of the following expressions?
A. (5 > 4) and (3 == 5) ⇒ False
not (5 > 4) ⇒ False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5) ⇒ True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) ⇒ False
(True and True) and (True == False) ⇒ False
(not False) or (not True) ⇒ True

5. What are the six comparison operators?
A.They are - less than(<), 
or less than equal to(<=), 
greater than(>)
 or greater than equal to(>=)
equal to(==)
not equal to (!=)

6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.
A. Assignment operator is denoted by a single =, eg ⇒ a=5, here a is assigned a value of 5
Equal to is denoted by ==, for example if we are trying to compare values⇒ a=5, b=5, a==b will yield True or False as an output i.e it gives boolean output

7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
    iprint('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')
spam = 0
A.if spam == 10: #1st block of code
    print('eggs')
if spam > 5: #2nd block of code
    print('bacon')
else:(3rd block of code)
    print('ham')
    print('spam')
print('spam')


8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
A.spam=1
if spam==1:
    print("Hello")
elif spam==2:
    print("Howdy")
else:
    print("Greetings")

9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys you’ll press?
A. We should press CTRL + C to break the loop


10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
A.The Python break statement stops or exits the loop in which the statement is placed. A Python continue statement skips the
current iteration in a loop and proceed with the next iteration

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
All the values of range(10), range(0,10) and range(0,10,1) are same and hence yields same result
12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
For Loop:
for i in range(1,11):
    print(i)
    i=i+ 1
While Loop
             i=1
             while i<11:
                      print(i)
                       i= i+1


13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, what would you call it after importing spam?
from spam import bacon
bacon()
